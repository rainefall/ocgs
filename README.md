# OpenGL Computer Graphics Studio

ocgs is a tool for creating and rendering animations and still images using code. It was originally created to aid me in the fast production of animated music videos in a classic 1980s CGI style, though it should be able to pull off just about any kind of visual style you can write GLSL shaders for. I work faster in code based environments than visual ones (such as every mainstream animation/rendering software package ever), and a vast majority of renderers these days are largely geared towards photorealism and not very programmable at all.
